title: Clutter-Free Screen Shot Sharing
---

It's common to want to share screen shots while keeping a tidy Desktop. This is
where the clipboard interaction shines. If you add **Control** to the standard
array of Mac screen shot shortcuts, it will save the image to your clipboard
instead of the Desktop. Now that the image is in your clipboard, simply hit the
hotkey to share it.

 1. Press **Control + Command + Shift + 4** to bring up the familiar Mac screen
    shot tool.

 2. **Take a screen shot** as you've always done. This screen shot will only
    exist in your clipboard and won't be saved to the Desktop. Don't forget you
can hit space to toggle between the crosshair and window selection tools.

 3. Press the **CloudApp Clipboard Hotkey** to upload the screen shot to
    CloudApp. The default is **Control + Option + C** but you're free to change
    it. Click the CloudApp icon in your menu bar and choose _Preferences..._ to
    see or change your hotkey.

 4. Share as you normally would any other Drop by pressing **Command + V**.
