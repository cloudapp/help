Thanks for trying [CloudApp for Mac][mas]! Let's get started by sharing your
first drop (Cloud-speak for upload).


## Sharing

CloudApp makes sharing easy. All you have to do is:

 - Drop a file on the CloudApp icon.
 - Paste the link to share it.

Simply drag a file from your Desktop or any Finder window and drop it on the
CloudApp icon in your menubar at the top right corner of your screen. CloudApp
will spring into action! When you hear a ding and see the icon turn blue, you
know your drop is ready to be shared with friends, co-workers, or the world.

CloudApp placed a sharable link to the file on your clipboard. The only thing
that's left to do is to paste it somewhere. Right click inside any text field --
chat window, email app, document -- and select "Paste" or use the Mac's keyboard
shortcut **Command + V**. Go ahead and give it a try by pasting the link inside
your browser's address bar and hitting enter. That's all there is to it.

That's only the beginning. Here's some other cool stuff you can share with
CloudApp:

 - Drop the address from your browser's address bar to share a bookmark.
 - Drop a picture from iPhoto to share it.
 - Select some text in a document and drop it to share a quick snippet.
 - Select and drop several files from Finder to share an archive of those files.


## Recent Drops

CloudApp puts your last few drops within easy reach. Click the CloudApp icon in
your menubar to open the Recent Drops menu. From there you can see how many
times a drop has been viewed or click it to open.

## Shortcuts

Not only does the Recent Drops menu allow you to track views, by holding down a
key or two you can quickly copy a drop's link, toggle its privacy, or delete it
outright. Below are all the actions available. Be sure to note how the drop's
icon changes. It's there to help you remember these shortcut.

 - **Click** a drop to see it.
 - **Command + Click** a drop to copy its link.
 - **Option + Click** a drop to toggle its privacy.
 - **Command + Option + Click** a drop to delete it.


## Clipboard Hotkey

Sometimes dragging and dropping can slow you down. Have no fear! CloudApp gives
you a keyboard shortcut to quickly share the latest entry from your clipboard.
Copy anything -- a document from Finder, a web address, a picture from iPhoto --
and press the hotkey **Control + Option + C**. It works exactly as if you had
dropped it on the CloudApp icon.


## Other Ways to Share

You probably have other gadgets than just your Mac. Chances are, they can
connect to CloudApp too.

[Our web app][web-app] is the tool of choice for when you need to see more than
your last 5 drops and is designed to complement the Mac app. The Mac app does
only what you need most of the time and the web app takes over from there.

There's also an ecosystem of [impressive third-party CloudApp
clients][third-party] made by some great developers. If you have an iOS or
Android device or a Windows PC, give one a shot.
