We want to keep CloudApp safe for everyone. If you've discovered a security
vulnerability in CloudApp, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a
responsible manner.

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put everyone using CloudApp at risk.
If you've discovered a security concern,
**please email us at [support@getcloudapp.com][support]**. We'll work with you
to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully
address your concern. We consider vulnerability disclosures our highest
priority and will address any issues as quickly as possible.

[support]: mailto:support@getcloudapp.com

Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your
disclosure. When testing for vulnerabilities, please only target your own
account and do not attempt to access or modify the data of others. We won't
take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if
you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.

Thanks!

Thank you for your help keeping the CloudApp community safe. We really
appreciate it.
