 - [Getting started with CloudApp][start]

   CloudApp makes sharing easy. Let us show you the ropes and you'll be an
   expert in no time.

 - [I can't share!][cant-share]

   It's quite frustrating to try and share something only to have it fail. There
   are a few simple things you can try to get back in the game.

 - [Clutter-free screen shot sharing][clutter]

   CloudApp and Mac OS X make it effortless to share screen shots. There's no
   reason to keep a shared screen shot laying around on your Desktop. Keep
   things tidy by using the clutter-free technique.

 - [Using a custom domain][domain]

   You own an awesome domain. Why not put it to work? Add some flair to your
   drop links by using your own domain in place of our `cl.ly`.

 - [Delete my CloudApp account][delete]

   Really? Why?! It's alright. You can keep that to yourself if you like.

 - [Presskit][presskit]

   Grab some sweet CloudApp assets for use in your review or critique of
   CloudApp.
