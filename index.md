 - Getting started with CloudApp

   CloudApp makes sharing easy. All you have to do is:

    - Drop a file on the CloudApp icon.
    - Paste the link to share it.

 - Clutter-Free Screenshot Sharing

   It's common to want to share screenshots while keeping a tidy Desktop. This
   is where the clipboard interaction really shines. If you add Control to the
   standard array of Mac screenshot shortcuts, it will save the image to your
   clipboard instead of desktop. Now that the image is in your clipboard, simply
   hit the hotkey to share it.

 - Custom Domains

   Domains are custom.

 - Delete your account

   Why?!

## Known Bugs

 - Tiny application icon.
 - Retina menu bar icon wonky when uploading.
